Project on the effects of charsharing services on individual transportation

In this project, I am analyzing how the existence of a carsharing service in a region affects private transport. This project idea is at an infancy stage. I have rather specific research design in mind that can hopefully be tackled with two publicly available datasets (information on the location of shared cars: https://carsharing.de/cs-standorte-ol3-v7, panel information on the number of newly registered cars at regional level: https://www.kba.de/DE/Statistik/Fahrzeuge/Neuzulassungen/neuzulassungen_inhalt.html?nn=2601598). Gathering the data requires me to setup a scraping framework to collect information in which regions/cities car sharing services exist and which companies run these services. This information exists but is not available in a structured format (at least not publicly). So, a first step will be the development of a scraping framework (possibly using rvest and RSelenium) which I will be happy to share via github.
