Project on the substitutional effects of regional charsharing offers on private transportation

In this project, I am analyzing how the existence of a carsharing service in a region affects private transport. This project idea is at an infancy stage. I have rather specific research design in mind that can hopefully be tackled with two publicly available datasets (information on the location of shared cars by Bundesverband CarSharing: https://carsharing.de/cs-standorte-ol3-v7, panel information on the number of newly registered cars at regional level by the Federal Motor Transport Authority: https://www.kba.de/DE/Statistik/Fahrzeuge/Neuzulassungen/neuzulassungen_inhalt.html?nn=2601598). Gathering the data requires me to setup a scraping framework to collect information in which regions/cities car sharing services exist and which companies run these services. This information exists but is not available in a structured format (at least not publicly). So, a first step will be the development of a scraping framework (using rvest and RSelenium) which I am happy to share here.
